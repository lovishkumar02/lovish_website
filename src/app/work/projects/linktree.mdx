## Overview

Development of a fully customized personal Linktree website using HTML and CSS, designed to centralize my professional presence across technology, diplomacy, leadership, and sustainability initiatives. The platform focuses on clean UI, smooth animations, and a strong personal brand identity.

## Key Features

- **Custom UI Design**: Built a clean, responsive layout from scratch using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques, ensuring cross-device compatibility and accessibility.
- **Animated Interactions**:Integrated smooth hover effects, button transitions, and subtle entrance animations using CSS keyframes and transitions to enhance user engagement.
- **Lightweight & Performance Optimized**: Avoided heavy frameworks to maintain fast loading speed and smooth performance.
- **Centralized Professional Links**: Organized links to portfolio, GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium, sustainability initiatives, and speaking engagements in a minimal, distraction-free format.
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: For layout styling, animations, responsiveness, and visual effects.
- **Google Fonts**: For typography enhancement.
- **Git & GitHub Pages**: For version control and deployment.
## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing minimalism with personality. While Linktree-style pages are typically simple, I aimed to embed motion and brand identity without compromising performance. Fine-tuning animation timing, hover feedback, and mobile responsiveness required iterative testing.

This project strengthened my understanding of UI polish, micro-interactions, and how subtle design decisions influence user perception.

## Outcome

The personalized Linktree now serves as a digital gateway to my work across technology, diplomacy, and sustainability. It reflects not just my links, but my identity — structured, intentional, and impact-driven.

It has improved how I share my work professionally, making networking, collaborations, and outreach more seamless and impactful.
